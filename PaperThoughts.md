### About Reading paper
1. Whether the paper has been admitted or not?      
2. Which fields MOT has been used to?               
3. What is the main difficulty about MOT?            
4. Why DRL was introduced to SOT? Advantages?                   
5. Whether DRL can solve the problem mentioned above?                      

### Summary
It is the idea which solved one problem in one particular field instead of what the writer did really matters. And before reading one paper in a particular field, I should have a deep investigation through the related fields such as what the field is mainly about, what the main difficultly concerning it and why it is not easy to be solved.    
When we read about one paper, we should keep it as a reminder to dig out the target problem about it and what's the fancy point in it. Besides, why the proposed methods can safely solve the target problem?

### About designing your own paper
1. What is the biggest difference between SOT and MOT?                 
2. If the main contribution is to make the algorithm faster, why it can be realized?                
3. What is your contribution if you just simply put the current method about SOT into MOT?

### Summary
The greatest difference between SOT and MOT is not just as what the paper talk about.     
In my previous summary:

SOT:       
- Aimed at tracking the object which moves very fast or whose background changes frequently and quickly.                   
- The target is easy to detect whose position is always around the center of every frame of a video.     
MOT:    
- Pick out all the objects, ususlly the pedestrains
- Those objects always interact with each other such as frequent occlusions, similar appearance(whether the object is one of the tracked object before)

It's the surface phenomenon but the essential and biggest problem remain to be discovered from the classic paper.

### About discover your own idea
If you just figure out the weakness of one methods, and then make for it with some other method, your contribution is zero. The idea is that you just aim at one small problem such as whether we can dig out the relationship between two people if they are always close to each other at physical position to increase the efficiency.

It's time to read through all the classic papers related to multiple object tracking and single object tracking. Summary all the problem of them and figure out some useful methods to improve the efficiency. It is the idea instead of merge two methods to improve efficiency and speed really matters.
