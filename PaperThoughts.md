### About Reading paper
1. Whether the paper has been admitted or not?      
2. Which fields MOT has been used to?               
3. What is the main difficulty about MOT?            
4. Why DRL was introduced to SOT? Advantages?                   
5. Whether DRL can solve the problem mentioned above?                      

### Summary
It is the idea which solved one problem in one particular field instead of what the writer did really matters. And before reading one paper in a particular field, I should have a deep investigation through the related fields such as what the field is mainly about, what the main difficultly concerning it and why it is not easy to be solved.    
When we read about one paper, we should keep it as a reminder to dig out the target problem about it and what's the fancy point in it. Besides, why the proposed methods can safely solve the target problem?

### About designing your own paper
1. What is the biggest difference between SOT and MOT?                 
2. If the main contribution is to make the algorithm faster, why it can be realized?                
3. What is your contribution if you just simply put the current method about SOT into MOT?

Remain to be seen...
